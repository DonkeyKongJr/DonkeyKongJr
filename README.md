Hi, I'm Patrick (he/him)— head of software development at [ACP Business Applications GmbH](https://www.acp.at/) working on constantly improving our happiness, environment and code. Previously worked as a senior software engineer at [pmOne](https://pmone.com) and as a head of software development and software engineer at [Provaria GmbH](https://provaria.com). I live in Leibitz, Austria. 🙌 I'm a massive nerd and technology fan looking for new possibilities and gadgets 24/7.

## My values
🤝 Unity is strength<br>
🌟 Leading by example<br>
🔝 Quality first<br>
🙌 Shared norms<br>
🚀 Diversity is key

## How I work
My motivations are to increase the quality and decrease the development time of our software tremendously. In a fast moving and changing world it is key to provide stable solutions for everybody. I love to use cutting edge technology but I don't fear a good old legacy monster.
